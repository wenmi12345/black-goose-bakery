            Bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour (usually
            wheat) and water, usually by baking. Throughout recorded history and
            around the world, it has been an important part of many cultures'
            diet. It is one of the oldest human-made foods, having been of
            significance since the dawn of agriculture, and plays an essential
            role in both religious rituals and secular culture. Bread is a

            prepared foods. Evidence from 30,000 years ago in Europe and
            Australia revealed starch residue on rocks used for pounding plants.
            It is possible that during this time, starch extract from the roots
            of plants, such as cattails and ferns, was spread on a flat rock,
            placed over a fire and cooked into a primitive form of flatbread.
            The oldest evidence of bread-making has been found in a
            14,500-year-old Natufian site in Jordan's northeastern desert.
            Around 10,000 BC, with the dawn of the Neolithic age and the spread
            of agriculture, grains became the mainstay of making bread. Yeast
            spores are ubiquitous, including on the surface of cereal grains, so
            any dough left to rest leavens naturally.

          A muffin is an individually portioned baked product; however, the term
          can refer to one of two distinct items: a part-raised flatbread (like
          a crumpet) that is baked and then cooked on a griddle (typically
          unsweetened), or a often swe are often sweetened, there are savory
          varieties made with ingredients such as corn and cheese, and less
          sweet varieties like traditional bran muffins. The flatbread "English"
          variety is of British or other European derivation, and dates from at
          least the early 18th century, while the quickbread originated in North
          America during the 19th century. Both types are common worldwide
          today.Bread is one of the oldest prepared foods. Evidence from 30,000
